# ML-Model-selection
A beginner-friendly machine learning project demonstrating dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, model comparison, and selecting the best model using accuracy and evaluation metrics.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and explore dataset  
- Preprocess data (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)  
- Train multiple ML models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNeighborsClassifier
  - Random ForestClassifier
  - SVC
  - RandomForestClassifier

- Compare model performance
- Compare model cross validation by (LR, SVC, KNC, RFC)
- Automatically select the best model
